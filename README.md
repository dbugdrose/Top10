//Favorite Top 10 Website
//Description: Created a website for Top 10 lists of our favorite songs. The project consists of multiple html file pages and external css classes that overwrite Bootstrap's built in css for styling purposes. The project also consists of multiple components that are called from Bootstrap's library and modified with container, row, and col classes to organize said components. The website also has responsiveness built in to accomodate for tablet screen sizes.
